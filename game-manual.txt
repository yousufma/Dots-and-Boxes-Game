About the Dots and Boxes Game:
The game is played on a grid of dots (in this case a 8x8 grid). You take your turn by placing a line in between any two not previously connected boxes, and if you complete a box (or two) by placing the fourth side, you claim any completed boxes. If a box is completed, that player may take another turn. If not, it is the other player’s turn. This repeats until one player has more than half of all available boxes, at which point they are declared the winner and the game ends.

How to Play:
Let’s play Dots and Boxes!
As described above, when you run the game you will first be greeted with a grid of 7 rows and 7 columns. You’re going to be playing against the CPU that we developed.
First, you will see a message asking you to enter the row number you want to place your line in. Once you’ve entered the row number, you will be asked to enter the column number. This is related to the column number you want to enter your line in. Now that you have a row and column selected, you have a square in mind, but you haven’t said which side of the square you want the line to be in. Therefore, you’ll be asked to enter the side of the square you want to place your line: 0 for a line at the top of the square, 1 for the right side, 2 for bottom, and 3 for left. After your turn, you will wait as the CPU makes its turn. After the CPU has completed its move, your turn restarts. The goal is to complete as many squares as possible.

After all of the boxes of the board are filled, a winner will be announced and the scores will be shown.
